 Project Goal!( ‚Ä¢ÃÄ œâ ‚Ä¢ÃÅ )‚úß

 
MoneyWise is designed to bridge the gap in financial literacy for students and young adults by providing an interactive, user-friendly web platform focused on budgeting, investing, and saving.

Our mission is to empower users with practical knowledge and tools that help them make smarter financial decisions, cultivate good money habits, and track their progress in an engaging and gamified way.

üí° Problem Statement


Financial literacy remains a critical yet under-addressed skill for many young people. Despite the abundance of online resources, existing tools often lack interactivity, motivation, and clarity, which hinders users‚Äô learning and application.

Key challenges we aimed to tackle:

Lack of engaging content and motivation to learn financial concepts.

Difficulties in tracking budgets, investments, and savings cohesively.

Need for accessible, multi-featured platforms that combine education with practical tools.

Poor user experience in current financial calculators and quizzes.
